I've always had a strong tendency towards perfectionism.

Regardless of the task, I love to overthink every decision, spending hours mulling over every option.

Dreaming of the greatness I know I can create, given the time and dedicated effort.

But that's what these lofty ideas only ever amount to; Dreams.

No great thing was made in a flash-bang. Greatness is made with iteration.
Nothing begins flawless. Decision paralysis cannot be the enemy of progress.

Perfection is a dream. Do something tangible.
