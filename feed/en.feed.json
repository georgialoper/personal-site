      "content_html": "<p>I’ve always had a strong tendency towards perfectionism.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the task, I love to overthink every decision, spending hours mulling over every option.</p>\n<p>Dreaming of the greatness I know I can create, given the time and dedicated effort.</p>\n<p>But that’s what these lofty ideas only ever amount to; Dreams.</p>\n<p>No great thing was made in a flash-bang. Greatness is made with iteration.<br>\nNothing begins flawless. Decision paralysis cannot be the enemy of progress.</p>\n<p>Perfection is a dream. Do something tangible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/developerLoper\">@GLo</a></p>\n",
